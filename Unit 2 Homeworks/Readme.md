# Executive Summary

Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab:

In this lab we are learning about the hardware component of Information Systems including the the transformation of the CPU, RAM, and memory.

# Hardware

## Hard Drives and Memory

* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?

Latency is a slower speed - Earlier technology had a CPU which had multiple moving parts which produced heat due to the amount of physical searching it may have to do. Transfer rate is a faster speed - this newer technology was created with no moving parts and a more efficient organization of data.

* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?

Solid state hard drives have no moving parts compared to traditional hard drives which have many.

* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?

RAM can transfer data much faster than the hard drive. When a computer starts up it loads the needed information into RAM. If there is not enough RAM to hold all that is needed then some of it stays behind in the hard drive. Now instead of the faster path of RAM direct to CPU, the data in RAM has to be supplemented by the slower transfer rate of the hard drive.

* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?

A 64 bit (DIMM) data path is able to transfer 62 bits of data in one clock cycle. A 32 bit (SIMM) data path can transfer only 32 bits in the same time frame. This means the 64 bit DIMM runs twice as fast as the 32 bit SIMM.

## ALU and Control Unit

* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU

The ALU is in charge of arithmetic and logic. The When a comparision needs to be made The Control Unit sends data with an instruction to the ALU. Once complete, the result is sent to output or flagged for later when The Control Unit needs that piece of information.

## CPU, Input and Output

*Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output

The input component is the keyboard which recieve the data by the depression of a key and sends a processiong request to the CPU. The CPU finds the correct instructions for the request and stores this procedure into memory. This information is then sent to an output device which in this case is the screen.

## Logic Gates and circuits

* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.

A truth table is an organized representation of all the possible inputs and their corresponding outputs of a logic gate. A . It outputs "true" when one or more but not all of its inputs are false. You can visualze this gate as follows:

## NAND GATE
## Input A  Input B  Output
   false    false    true
   false    true     true
   true     false    true
   true     true     false

* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate?

A NAND (Negated AND) gate acts the opposite of an AND gate.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design

The IEEE is a group that supports those in the Electronics and Electrical Engineers. It is an Instutue that is dedicated to advancing inovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. Because these technologies can be used for "good" or "bad", the IEEE has come up with a set of best practices when it comes to Artifical Intelligence (AI) in particular. This designers' code of ethics has five basic components: Accountability, Value Alignment, Explainability, Fairness, and User Data Rights.

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions

* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers

The decimal system is based upon the math of tens, base-10. The first place is ten to the power of zero whch is 1. The second place is ten to the power of one which is ten. The third place is ten to the power of two which is 100. And so on.

The binary system is based upon the math of twos, base-2, The lowest place is two to the power of zero whch is 1. The second place is ten to the power of one which is four. The third place is ten to the power of two which is eight. And so on.

The hexadecimal system is based on the math of 16s, base-16, The lowest place is sixteen to the power of zero whch is 1. The second place is sixteen to the power of one which is sixteen. The third place is ten to the power of two which is 256. And so on.

* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file) and save to a file named DecimalConversion and upload to your lab folder.

The decimal number 211 is represented as the binary number . Please see the attached file for further details.

## Hexadecimal color representation

* Convert the binary representation: 10110101 to decimal and save your work to a file named BinaryConversion and upload to the lab folder.
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered.
