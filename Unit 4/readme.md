# Executive Summary
Update this section for this lab explaining the purpose of the lab

In this week's lab we learn about Logos and create one. We learn about various file extension formats in which they could be saved. We are introduced to the command line prompt.

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.

A Raster enlarged image becomes more pixelated the bigger you make it because the original has only so many pixels.
A Vector enlarged image can be used to size any image because they use a special geometry.

* Include examples of when each would be most appropriate.

If the image is not going to be made too much bigger than it already is, then use a roster image.
If you'd like to use the image in many sizes, then use a vector inage.


## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?

Lossless formats preserve all the data from the original image, no details are lost.
Lossy formats remove some of the data from the original to save the image in a reduced file size, if space is an issue.

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files.

GIF: allows for animations of images and simple graphiics like logos and line drawings; avoid if the image has gradients or is a photo
  
JPEG: allows for the subtle shifts and sharp contrasts of color and for the designer to fine-tune the image; avoid if image is high contrast, detailed, is a diagram, or has simple graphics (creates files that are too large)

PNG allows for illustrations with multiple gradients, detaile diagrams, contrast, and partial transparency: avoid if image has low contrast (or larger file sizes)

# Operating Systems
* Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

see the attached files DirectoryStructureCommandPrompt 1-5

## Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks

see both uploads: one version is Word, I could get it close but not perfect, it is explained in the screenshot
one version is in Vectr which I could not get to work, even for something as simple as my logo, it ran out of space

* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required

My images design is a one layer extremely simple design using primary colors. (I've been fiddling with it for a few weeks.) 

* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." 
  What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)
  
  My logo would be best saved as a GIF.

# Conclusion
Summarize what you learned here

I finally learned what is meant by .gif .jpeg and .png file extenstions. I had no idea they were so particular. I learned what are the advantages for  each type as well as what to avoid doing within these types.
