# Executive Summary
Update this section for this lab explaining the purpose of the lab

In this week's lab we learn about Logos and create one. We read about various file extension formats in which they could be saved and how files can be enlagred and/or compressed into these formats. We are also introduced to working at the terminal level, then command line prompt.

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.

A Raster enlarged image becomes more pixelated the bigger you make it because the original has only so many pixels.

A Vector enlarged image can be used to size any image because they use a special geometry.

* Include examples of when each would be most appropriate.

If the image is not going to be made too much bigger than it already is, then use a roster image.

If you'd like to use the image in many sizes, then use a vector inage.


## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?

Lossless formats preserve all the data from the original image, no details are lost.

Lossy formats remove some of the data from the original to save the image in a reduced file size, if space is an issue.

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files.

GIF: allows for animations of images and simple graphiics like logos and line drawings; avoid if the image has gradients or is a photo
  
JPEG: allows for the subtle shifts and sharp contrasts of color and for the designer to fine-tune the image; avoid if image is high contrast, detailed, is a diagram, or has simple graphics (creates files that are too large)

PNG allows for illustrations with multiple gradients, detaile diagrams, contrast, and partial transparency: avoid if image has low contrast (or larger file sizes)

# Operating Systems
* Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

I have so many screenshots: the most relevant are the ones uploaded on July 1. I looked through the index of the macOS command prompts and  I could not figure out how access the system information.

## Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks

I have a million uploads: PizzaLoga is what you want; my DataJ logo; I have no idea what I opened previously, but that vectr program and this vectr program were totally not the same.

* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required

The pizza logo I created eas 12 "layers". My realized DataJ logo was 3 "layers".

* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." 
  What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)
  
  Both would be best saved using GIF.

# Conclusion
Summarize what you learned here

I finally learned what is meant by .gif .jpeg and .png file extenstions. I had no idea they were so particular. I learned what are the advantages for  each type as well as what to avoid doing within these types. Vector enlarged and Lossless compressed images retain all the information about the original image. Whereas, Raster enlarged images do not have enough information for proper enlargementand. And, Lossy compressed images remove data from the original image. I was able to create a file in a folder at the terminal level, then find it at the windows level with the help of the magnifiying glass at the top right of my screen. I'd never used that one before.
