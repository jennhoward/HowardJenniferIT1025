# Executive Summary

Type your executive summary as if you were explaining your lab on an IT team
In this first lab we learn the basics of Information Systems and their history.

# Information System Componentsâ€¯

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

The hardware of the ATM is the machine itself. The software is that which provides the GUI that allows us to find our way through the program. The data are items like our password and the monetary amounts that we enter during the transaction. The people would be a team including the programmers themsleves and those in the banking industry who provide the specifications. The process is: build the CPU/motherboard, build the machine; setup the physical placement of the machine, and there may be some beta testers along the way.

# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture. Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model.

In a "Client-Server" architecture there are users who access a mainframe from  a console. GitHub's has a main "location" (the website is its interface) where all of the data lives. We access that data by logging onto the website from a computer.

* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?

GitHub has a general "place" (like a server with major storage capacity) in which all programs live and are stored and are shared. There is no hardware to which a person has access nor is the software on their CPU/motherboard. It is a vurtual environment where all that is need is the internet.

We have cloud computers at our office. Since I work in the healthcare industry, all information is considered HIPPA protected. Our computers have no hard drives, they are shells basically. When you log onto your desktop, that doesn't even exsist on the computer directly. Everything is accessed via the web.

# Conclusion

In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.

I have been working with computers and computer systems in various industries for maybe 30 years. I was the first personin the office to receive a cloud computer. When all components had been removed from the box, I looked back into the box. Corporate forgot to give me a CPU/harddrive. I laughed, along with everyone else in the office. When this whole cloud saving idea was put into use, I didn't trust it one bit. I do have a MAC, and I still do not use "The Cloud" for storage. On the one hand, neither of these technologies one their own is a paradigm shift of something I could not understand. But putting them together is a paradigm shift: working on a computer that's not a computer, using software tht doesn't exsit where I am sitting, saving wy work in some amorphous cloud (really a huge server or set of servers). And here's the shift: all my programs, data, etc are availble to me whereever I can get access to the web. I can use the (physically) smallest machine and it has anything I need. If someone steal my computer, that doesn't even matter... my work is "somewhere else" entirely. I do not know what the next paradigm shift will be, but I will probably laugh just as hard and be just as untrusting as the one that just passed. The IT Industry has come a long way thanks to IT.
