# Executive Summary
Write up as though you are explaining this week's lab to others.

This week we explore the possibilities of IT careers: via general search, via possible internship or co-op, looking through the IT programs offered by Tri-C. We learn about software and virtualization and try out a new programing language, Python. 

# Software
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each.

Operating Systems manage hardware resources, provides user-interface components, and provide a platform for software applications.
Applications are written by developers for people to use accomplish everyday things like creating spreadsheets.
Utility software provides a way to fix, modify, or totally remove software. 

* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example.

ERPs use central databases to impliment organization-wide processes in an efficient way. The corporation for which I work uses "cloud computers." This had made software updates a breeze compared to when we had or regular desktops.

* Explain the purpose of virtualization and describe how it differs from cloud computing.

Virtualization takes advantage of all the space on the server by splitting it up in various ways. 
Virtualization is software whereas Cloud Computing is a service

# Python
* Follow the tasks for pythong coding. Then upload screenshot of python code (named Python) and output to this folder

See Attached Screen Shot

# Virtualization
* What types of problems are solved with virtualization?

Problems solved with virtualization include reducing the number of physical servers a company needs to use which reduces the anount of electricity the company has to use run and cool actual physical servers which saves money that couple be used for something else the comany needs.

* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?

Hypervisors separates the physical resources of the partitioned server from the virtual environments being used by people who are using those resources.

# Career Exploration
## Career Exploration
### Tri-C College Central:
* Register for a student account: Did this over the weekend.
* Use one of the search options such as "Search - Intern Central," take a screenshot of the listings (include your name in the upper right-hand corner in your screenshot,) name the file: CollegeCentral and upload to your lab folder.

See attached screen shot: SuccessfulInternshipSearch

### Bureau of Labor Statistics
* Go to: Bureau of Labor Statistics website and continue exploring careers in IT (or your area of interest.) You can search for "web developer" or "network" or "cyber" and see what jobs appear. Report your findings including job title, salary and projected growth. You can upload a screenshot if you want.

See attached screen shot: OperationsResearchAnalyst

## Industry Certification
* Explore a certification and report your findings. (CompTIA , Cisco , CISSP or any other certification)

Cisco Industrial Network Specialist is under The Internet of Things category which stood out because this is my research project subject. This certifcation ensures that one has the required knowledge in networked industrial controlled systems and understands networking technologies.

## College Certificates
* Explore the Tri-C certificates at: Tri-C IT Programs and report on a certificate of interest (short-term or post-degree.)
I have attached a screen shot of the Data Analytics Post Deg Prof Cert Class Schedule. This is my goal.

See attached Screen Shot: DataAnalyticsClassSchedule

* Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship

I need only to click on the bright violet button to check out the possibilities. Co-Op is an opportunity to: try out a path of interest to see if you want to make it a career; see how the business world operates; and begin networking in your field of interest. Also - See attatched screen shot: Co-Op Possibility

## Professional Membership
* Pick one of the IT organizations like IEEE or ACM or a student club and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.

Institute of Electrical and Electonics Engineers (IEEE): Their purpose is to advance technology for humanity and the  profession. This means they ensure that the industry is being fair both the to general public and althroughout the profession. Technology can be used for good or bad, and thy support the good. Being a member allows you an avenue for reamining current in the industry and opportunties for networking.

# Conclusion
Summary of your understanding from this week's lab:

Virtual computers and cloud systems allow for a much more efficient use of technology. I got experience using another programming language, Python. Tri-C provides many ways to figure out what you want to do with the degree you earn. Co-ops and internships allow you to gain real-wrold experience to actually do that job for a time. In my situation these are unnecessary as I've worked in IT in many ways throughout my many jobs. My goal has been Data Analytics for which I'd already done the necessary research. But I do still need to find an advisor.
