# Executive Summary

Explain the goal for this lab

## LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that asks for a number and then

* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10. 
* Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: 
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm 
* Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)

I love flow charts! I have been working with and using flowcharts for a very long time. I like how they show the logic within a a process. Lucidchart made it simple to create the chart itself, including making it easy to space things evenly. I hade some fun coloring in all the various shapes different colors.

# Networking
## Intro to Networking

## Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 
 
(2) IP Address
* (A) Set of rules to allow devices to communicate Unit of data Unique identifying number 

(1) Packet Packet-Switching 
* (B) Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 

(3) DNS Protocol
* (C) Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)

## Network Hardware

* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.

Switches are intelligent because they are able to learn all the physical addresses of all the devices that are connected to it resulting in computers that receive only the data that is meant for them. Hubs do not filter any of the data and broadcasts it too all connected devides.

* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.

Hubs and Switches can be used only in LANs whereas routers create networks (WANs) via IP addresses. And not only will routers receive only the data that is intended for them but it bounces all other data along creating a much better security of the data.

## Network Topology

* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.

A single point failure is a failure at one point in the network that caudes the whole network go crash because of the topology of that network such as Ring and Bus Networks and Infrastructre Topology.

* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?

Infrastructre Topology is similar to star topology in that all computers are connected to a central point; so like s Hub and Switch Netorks, when the central point goes down so does the network. In a Wireless Mesh Topology all devices are interconnected to each other. Each wireless access point will talk to other wireless access points creating a seamless internet connection. I would choose WMTs (over Mesh) because are extremely redundant and thus not affected by single point failure. Also, WMTs have no cables or wires making them easire and less expensive to set up.


## Cybersecurity and Encryption
* Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job
* Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication
* Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
* Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key
* Explain why we need public key cryptography.

## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message. Then explain the encryption here:

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result. b) Would it be different for different languages?

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?" Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word. Explain the result.

## Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?
